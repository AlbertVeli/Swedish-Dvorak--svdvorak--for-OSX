SwedishDvorak.keylayout for Mac OS X

This keyboard layout provides a Swedish Dvorak (svdvorak)
keyboard layout. The major difference between this and the
svorak layout is the placement of the ä and ö keys.


Installation

1. Download `SwedishDvorak.keylayout`.
2. Move the file to `/Library/Keyboard Layouts`.
3. Restart the computer.
4. Open System Preferences,
    go to Language & Text,
    then Input Sources, and
    tick Swedish Dvorak (svdvorak) in the list of input methods.
5. Check "Show input menu in menu bar" to change keyboard layout
    from the menu bar.
6. To use the keyboard layout on the login screen,
    open System Preferences, go to Accounts, then Login Options and
    select "Show input menu in login window".

The original NorwegianDvorak.keylayout was created by
Vidar Bronken Gundersen - http://github.com/vibrog/no-dvorak-osx

I created this layout by opening the NorwegianDvorak.keylayout
file in Ukulele and switched places between the Swedish ö and ä
and the Norwegian/Danish ø and æ. That should be pretty close to
the svdvorak variant in Xorg.
